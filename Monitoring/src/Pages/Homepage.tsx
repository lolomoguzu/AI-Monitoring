      <h1>What is Hydrophonic Plants?</h1>
      <p>
        Hydroponic plants are grown without soil, using a nutrient-rich water
        solution that provides essential minerals directly to their roots. This
        method allows plants to grow faster and healthier, using significantly
        less water than traditional soil-based farming. Instead of soil, plants
        are supported by materials like clay pellets, coconut coir, or rock
        wool. Hydroponic systems are widely used in greenhouses and indoor
        farms, making it possible to grow fresh produce year-round, even in
        urban areas with limited space. This innovative farming technique
        reduces the risk of soil-borne diseases, increases crop yields, and
        promotes sustainable agriculture.
